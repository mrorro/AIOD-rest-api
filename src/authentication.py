"""
We use keycloak for authentication and authorization.

The overall idea is that:
- The frontend uses a public client (without a secret) and authenticates the user
- The frontend passes the token to the backend
- The backend (i.e. this project) decodes the token to obtain the username
- The backend performs an authorization request to Keycloak, obtaining the permissions. It uses a
    private client for this request.

The main reason to perform a separate authorization request in the backend is that the frontend
should not be responsible for keeping the permissions up to date. Explanation: instead of only
obtaining the permissions from the decoded token, the backend could also take the permissions.
This is perfectly safe (the token cannot be changed without knowing the private key of keycloak).
But then the frontend needs to make sure that the permissions are up-to-date. Every front-end
should therefor request a new token every X minutes. This is not needed when the back-end
performs a separate authorization request. The only downside is the overhead of the additional
keycloak requests - if that becomes prohibitive in the future, we should reevaluate this design.
