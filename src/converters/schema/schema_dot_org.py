Schema.org Dataset is an industry standard to describe Dataset Metadata. Founded by Google,
Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex, Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open community process.
See https://schema.org/Dataset.

Using pydantic_schemaorg was not possible. Swagger does not play nicely with the circular
references present in the schema.
